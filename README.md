# Task 2: Titanic Dataset Exploration and Analysis

## 📌 Objective

The objective of this task is to explore the Titanic dataset using Python and perform data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). This analysis provides insights into passenger demographics and survival patterns.

## 📁 Dataset Description

The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic ship, including:

| Column Name | Description                                 |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `PassengerId` | Unique identifier for each passenger       |
| `Survived`    | Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)          |
| `Pclass`      | Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)   |
| `Name`        | Name of the passenger                      |
| `Sex`         | Gender of the passenger                    |
| `Age`         | Age of the passenger                      |
| `SibSp`       | Number of siblings/spouses aboard         |
| `Parch`       | Number of parents/children aboard         |
| `Ticket`      | Ticket number                              |
| `Fare`        | Passenger fare                             |
| `Cabin`       | Cabin number                               |
| `Embarked`    | Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton) |

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The analysis includes:

1. **Missing Values Check**
   - Identifies and handles missing data (especially in `Age`, `Cabin`, and `Embarked`).

2. **Survival Rate Visualization**
   - Bar plots showing survival rate by gender and class.

3. **Age Distribution**
   - Histogram of passenger ages.
   - Box plots of age by survival.

4. **Correlation Heatmap**
   - Visual representation of correlations between numeric features.

5. **Fare Analysis**
   - Distribution of ticket fares and relation to survival.

6. **Embarked Port Analysis**
   - Count of passengers based on embarkation point.
